# Generative Art
This repo contains my shenanigans regarding generative art.

Code done following [generative artistry](https://generativeartistry.com/) website.

## Run
A `Makefile` is provided with the corresponding scripts to start serving the files. At this moment the corresponding scripts are:
```bash
make tiled # For tiled lines
make stop # To stop the containers
```
